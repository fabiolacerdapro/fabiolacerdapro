ðŸ‘‹ Hello! I'm FÃ¡bio, a back-end web developer with over 6 years of experience. My passion is creating efficient and scalable solutions using PHP language and frameworks like Laravel. I have extensive knowledge in database design, query optimization, and software architecture. My journey as a developer started with the goal of building robust applications that meet user needs and bring a positive impact.

In addition to PHP, I also have skills in other web technologies such as MySQL, JavaScript, and HTML/CSS. I always strive to stay updated with the latest trends and best practices in the industry to deliver high-quality solutions. That's why I'm moving towards creating solutions using JavaScript and its entire ecosystem for web and mobile.

If you're looking for a back-end web developer who seeks new opportunities for professional development, feel free to get in touch. I would love to discuss collaboration opportunities and help turn ideas into reality through programming.
